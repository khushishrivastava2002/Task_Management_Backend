##### Purpose to create this empty file ------------


"""

1) Making a Directory a Package: In Python, an empty __init__.py file marks a directory as a Python package. This allows you to import modules or submodules from that directory using the dot notation (e.g., from my_package.my_module import my_function). Without this file, Python treats the directory as a regular directory and not a package, preventing such imports.


2) Initialization Code (Optional): While the file is often empty, you can add initialization code in __init__.py to execute when the package is imported. For example, you might import commonly used modules or set up package-level configurations. In most FastAPI projects, this file remains empty unless specific initialization is needed.


3) Namespace Management: It helps organize your code into a hierarchical structure, making it easier to manage larger applications with multiple files and directories.
